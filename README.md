ColorOpacity

Android color opacity transformation by Java, just a little for fun.
Android uses Hex ARGB values, which are formatted as #AARRGGBB. That
first pair of letters, the AA, represent the Alpha Channel. You must 
convert your decimal opacity values to a Hexdecimal value. 
This program determine your AA to percent.
